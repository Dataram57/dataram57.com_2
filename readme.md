# [dataram57.com](https://dataram57.com/) Version 2

This is my second version of my website.

## Constraints and goals

- Static pages.
    - HTML, CSS files preferred
- Scripts as low as possible
    - Keep JS files individually for each role.
    - PHP is fine, but keep PHP files also individually for each role. ***I plan to move my website on free hosting servers, so PHP or server side coding might not be possible.***
- No separate services like databases or making calls.
    - Use Files or ZK.

## Lessons

# TODO

- Admin Authentication via Fiat-Shamir/RSA ZK proof of knowing a private key to produce public key.
- Ignore files/dirs list. 

# Pipeline

1. Module processing (optional) - HTML components building
2. Oven picking - HTML component picking
3. Baking HTML
