This is my second version of my website.

## Constraints and goals

- Static pages.
    - HTML, CSS files preferred
- Scripts as low as possible
    - Keep JS files individually for each role.
    - PHP is fine, but keep PHP files also individually for each role.
- No separate services like databases or making calls.
    - Use Files or ZK.

- Ignore files/dirs list.
