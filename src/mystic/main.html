    <h1>Description</h1>
    <h3>Mystic</h3>
    <p>Mystic is a pseudo-stealth game built on a Quake Engine, inspired by the Thief series and Quake mod "In the Shadows".</p>
    <p>The current version, Enoch-0.9.0, features only 1 level, and not all story features have been implemented. Game development is in progress</p>
    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p><strong>Durven</strong> was a man of unknown origin. In the kingdom of Bauland, he was known for his trade activities with Shadorian merchants. Selling guns to children and spreading antisocial heresies were the kinds of activities that eventually led him to be sentenced to life in prison. That was until the day a new prisoner accidentally dropped a mysterious amulet, from which the ghost of the Desertian <strong>Princess Deshira</strong> emerged and spoke to <strong>Durven</strong>.</p><h3>Disclaimer</h3><p>Schwarze Sonne and Kali Yuga symbols featured in the first level have nothing to do with the message of the game, nor game try to promote ideologies associated with these symbols. Both of these symbols served for architectural and decorative purposes. If you know better alternatives, please let me know.</p>
