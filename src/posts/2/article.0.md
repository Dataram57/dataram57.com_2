# Report 18/9/2025

Ok, it’s report time.

A few things have changed since my last report.

Briefly speaking about **Mystic**: I have added a few new features to my game, such as displaying objectives. Next, I will be working on the inventory system to make it more like the one in *Thief*.

Another thing I’ve been working on for the past four days is setting up **CachyOS** on my main laptop, as well as installing other programs that I used on Windows. And well... what can I say? I am officially independent from corporate "globo-homo" software like Windows and Google Android. If I want to run Windows apps on Linux, I will either use Wine (Wine/Lutris/Bottles) or, in the worst case, Docker containers with Windows. When it comes to running Linux apps on Linux, depending on how "suspicious" the software looks, I’ll try to compile it either in a Docker environment or natively.

So anyway, I now have:

* CachyOS on my main laptop
* GrapheneOS on my phone
* Ubuntu on my travel laptop

The rest of the days were spent studying for my retake exam, but... egh... I think I failed this one. I just... I don’t know. Emotions, of course, are partly to blame, but also the assumptions I made at the start of the exam. I can only hope that I’ll pass it. Even if not, thankfully, this subject won’t be too hard to retake, since I have most of the material already finished. Plus, the subject orchestrator claims to offer faster completion so I won’t have to deal with it for a whole year.

That’s all for now.
