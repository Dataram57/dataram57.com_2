# My first article here.

Yup, that's my new website. It's not fully integrated yet, and I think I will have to come up with another solution to sync all the files between the hosting server and my private pc. My new website version aimed to clean up the mess, simplify the way I modify the website, and break free from the JS dependencies that were in the first version (such as Bootstrap, Markdown, and my messy JS).

Some remain untouched (mostly) to keep the links alive, some will get archived, and perhaps some will be just deleted.

Anyway... let it be my small report for the moment.

So, quite a lot of things have changed. First of all, I will have 1 retake this year, and independent of the result, I will step into the fifth semester of my engineering journey. Another interesting news is that I have switched my phone OS to GrapheneOS. I have also been studying quite a lot about cryptography and privacy in general these days, and now I am reading a book instead of asking ChatGPT what to look for (although it did help a lot).

My Quake blue map... hmm... Yup, I have been working quite a lot on it, and... idk check #progress on my discord and see there.

That's it for now.
I am sorry, but I just don't want to write words. I feel like it is a waste of time if I have my library made specifically for it (reflections, summaries, and so on... maybe even reports one day).
