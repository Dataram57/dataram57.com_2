Alright, it's 00:04, and it's time that I can reflect on myself.

So yeah... The school... 5th semester and as I wait for the last grade to come out I can expect at least 1 retake (2 if the awaiting one fails me).

When it comes to my private projects... Well, not a lot has changed in terms of the subjects. But in terms of practices and deeper analysis, I have made some progress, I think. I feel sick of PCs right now, yet I know that I still haven't achieved the dream visioned by the ideas that are in my head. Everything takes time, and sadly, when you even start researching already existing solutions, you may encounter some sort of trust factor which at the beginning you promised yourself to never rely on. Hence, I was forced to write my own tool for [making remote backups](https://github.com/Dataram57/cheap-disk-backup). I still have no trust in myself/own-code, so I prefer to stay cautious before saying that I have developed a nicely working tool. I must test it myself first.

Right now, I am working on enriching my life with locally encrypted backups and archives, but for that I want to use traditional encryption and transfer layers, such as LUKS, cryptsetup. Storing backups on the cloud is only one side of the coin. The second is stored locally, a place where the internet connection is not required to enter. When I finish setting this up, and I will be sure I am safe with this, I will have to find another topic to work on.

When it comes to cryptography, especially ZK and Homomorphic encryption, I think my [Pedersen Commitment Circuit Compiler](https://github.com/Dataram57/zkPedersenCircuitCompiler) and [TornadoCash as a voting system](https://github.com/Dataram57/bd_lab) have already become a decent product of what this journey had taught me. Surely, cryptography has changed my life into more critical one, but living a life like that takes a lot of time to spend on researching, analyzing vulnerabilities, finding pros and cons, balance or gnosis. I think I can suspect that that's the price that I have to get used to and potentially may be one-time/ephemeral. But for now, I think I should get back to the local earth and literally fortify my moving castle/home.

What's next? IDK, I just need to get out of this cryptographic egregore, and the only way I can do this is by finishing what I planned it to support (left: encrypted local backups and archives). What's after that? IDK, maybe my return to working on Mystic, or maybe some other stuff... which may be more related to work that I finally should somewhere... but school still scares and surprises with stuff that you don't want to study. Or maybe I really do have autism... IDK.

That's all for today.
Hope the future will be fruitful for me.
