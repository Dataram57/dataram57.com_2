    <h1>My own library</h1>
    <p>Yes I have a tiny library which you can access here (JS required): <a target="_blank" href="https://dataram57.neocities.org/library/#">https://dataram57.neocities.org/library/#</a>
    <br> Please keep in mind that this library was meant to be simple, easy to handle, and most importatnly less formal that this website. Don't be surprised to find weird stuff.

<h1>Why I wanted to read these books?</h1>
<p>
    By forcing yourself to read a book, you voluntarily become a slave to the book. When you finish reading a book, you feel like you are no longer a slave. As if you have just escaped prison.
    <br/><br/>
    By taking a loan, playing a game, listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/70R365Ss4Q8" target="_blank">music</a>, or even participating in society, you can also become a slave. Opening a bridge to something may turn you into a slave of that specific bridge/connection, and the truth is that almost everything in this world works this way. We sell our freedom either consciously or not. 
    <br/><br/>
    But just like with the Babel, the escape(collapse) may also bring you profits in the end. The concept of cyclic enslaving and freeing yourself from something may be a good self-balancing lifestyle to live. To maximize the yield of Babel/Prison's heritage, I would suggest picking a prison with potentially worth potential.
    <br/><br/>
    Hence, I read these books.
